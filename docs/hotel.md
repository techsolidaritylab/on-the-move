## Getting to the Hotel from the Airport 

### Option 1: Airport Shuttle + Trolley

**Free Airport Shuttle:** Upon arriving at the San Diego airport, you are encouraged to take the free electric shuttle bus, the “San Diego Flyer,” from the airport to the Old Town Transit Center located at 4005 Taylor Street, San Diego, CA 92110. The shuttle operates seven days a week every 20-30 minutes, stopping at both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 transportation islands before stopping at the Old Town Transit Center.

From there, you can take the Blue Line trolley going towards UTC directly to the Executive Drive Trolley stop, which will drop you a ~5-10 Min walk from the hotel.
