**Pacific Beach**

**Mission Beach**  
Just south of Pacific Beach, this beach has a [roller coaster called The Giant Dipper](https://www.belmontpark.com/history) and walkable boardwalk with restaurants and bars. 

**Ocean Beach**  
This beach has more of a hippy vibe with blocks of shops and sand to explore.   
[Pizza Port](https://www.pizzaport.com/) is a locals favorite for locally brewed beers and, well, pizza.   
[Ocean Beach Coffee and Plants](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VAnt41T3wfgH4gfF7) is a coffee shop on an open patio filled with, you guessed it, plants.   
[Newbreak Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qMQSahd5MdZ8HGs28) is a chill cafe with big tables, sandwiches, coffee, and a view across the sand to the beach. 

**Barrio Logan**  
[Chicano Park](https://chicano-park.com/) \- This park is such an important place of worker and Chicano struggle in San Diego. Carlos Pelayo, one of our conference attendees, is on its steering committee so ask him about it. The park is covered in murals telling important stories of worker and environmental struggles and also stories of beauty like low riders and poetry. 

Walk down Imperial Avenue along Chicano Park east to explore a neighborhood with incredible art, clothing, sneakers, food, and the activist bookstore [Libelula](https://share.google/6Mrm3qMoBLXGfKJ2c).
